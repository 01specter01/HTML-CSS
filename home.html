        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Munich's previous airport, Munich-Riem Airport, was operational from 1939 to 1992. Initial plans for an
            expansion of the airport date back to the year 1954. With rising passenger numbers and a growing number of
            inhabitants in its proximity, plans were made to completely move the airport to another site. The Bavarian
            government took the decision to build a new airport in the area called "Erdinger Moos" on 5 August 1969.
            When construction started on 3 November 1980, the small village of Franzheim disappeared and its
            approximately 400 inhabitants were resettled. The airport is located on the territory of four different
            municipalities: Oberding (location of the terminals; district of Erding), Hallbergmoos, Freising, and
            Marzling in the district of Freising.</p><!--Paragraph element-->

        <p>The new Munich airport commenced operations on 17 May 1992, and all flights to and from Munich were moved to
            the new site overnight. Munich-Riem closed on 16 May 1992 shortly before midnight.</p>

        <p>The airport is named after Franz Josef Strauss, who played a prominent, albeit sometimes controversial, role
            in West German politics from the 1950s until his death in 1988. Amongst other positions, Strauss was a
            long-time Minister-President (Governor) of the state of Bavaria. Strauss, a private pilot himself, initiated
            the new airport project and was particularly interested in attracting the aviation industry to Bavaria. He
            is regarded as one of the fathers of the Airbus project and served as initial chairman of the Airbus
            supervisory board.[9]</p>

        <p>Flughafen München GmbH, which owns and operates Munich Airport, is a limited liability company consisting of
            three shareholders: the State of Bavaria (51%), the Federal Republic of Germany (26%) and the City of Munich
            (23%). The logo of Munich Airport consists of the letter "M" with the slogan "Living ideas – Connecting
            lives". Munich Airport is usually referred to as "Flughafen München" or simply "MUC", its IATA code. During
            construction, the airport was referred to as "Flughafen München II". </p>
        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <p>As their home base at Frankfurt Airport suffered from capacity limits back then, Lufthansa established a
            second hub offering several short- and long-haul connections through Munich in addition to Frankfurt. While
            Lufthansa serves more European destinations from Munich Airport than from Frankfurt Airport, Frankfurt has
            many more intercontinental routes. </p>
        <p>
            Between 1995 and 2006, passenger numbers doubled from under 15 million per annum to over 30 million,[10]
            despite the impact of the 11 September attacks in 2001 and 2002. In 1996 the airport overtook Düsseldorf as
            Germany's second-busiest airport and currently handles almost twice as many passengers as the country's
            third-busiest </p>
        <p>In June 2003, construction of Terminal 2 was completed and it was inaugurated as an exclusive facility for
            Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners. </p>
        <p>In November 2013, the airport introduced its first new corporate design since its inauguration. The large
            letter 'M' remains in a new font type, and a dash has been added which changes between several colors. There
            are also animated color-changing versions of the 'M'-sign placed throughout the airport area, for example on
            the main entrance road and on the new Terminal 2 satellite.[11]</p>
        <p>In June 2015, Condor announced it intends to establish a long-haul base at Munich Airport from the 2016
            summer season. Condor has already based short- and mid-haul operations at the airport and resumed long-haul
            flights in winter 2013 after a six-year absence.[12] In November 2015, Transavia announced their intention
            to establish their first German base at Munich Airport which will consist of four aircraft serving 18 new
            routes by spring 2016.[13] As of June 2015, the biggest foreign carrier in Munich in terms of passenger
            numbers is Air Dolomiti.[14]</p>
        <p>More than 40 million passengers passed through the airport in 2015, a record at the time.[15]</p>
        <p>In December 2016, Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Eurowings announced that it would establish a major base at
            Munich Airport from March 2017, with 32 new routes.[16] These new base operations was carried out by Air
            Berlin on a new wet-lease contract with Eurowings.[17] In February 2017, Transavia announced the closure of
            their entire base at Munich Airport by October 2017 after only a year of service due to a change in their
            business strategy and negative economic outlook.[18]</p>
        <p>Munich Airport's dynamic growth continued in 2018 with new traffic records and an all-time high of 46.2
            million passengers. The airport also saw a strong surge in take-offs and landings, with 413,000 movements,
            an increase of 2.2% in 2018. With 266 destinations Munich Airport increased its global network and is among
            the leading air transportation hubs in Europe.[2]</p>
        <p>In February 2021, Lufthansa announced it would take over most of Eurowings's routes in Munich with the
            exception of few domestic services and flights to Palma de Mallorca and Pristina.[19]</p>
